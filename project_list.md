# Project List

## Portal Sekolah

**Company:** Noble Software / Visiprima  
**Role:** Lead Frontend Developer  
**Duration:** 2019 - Present  

### Stack
- Javascript
- Typescript
- React (Nextjs)
- Redux environment (Redux Toolkit, React-redux)
- Jest, React Testing Library
- Storybook
- CI/CD
- SASS (CSS Preprocessor)
- Ionic Framework

### Description
I take over an important role in this company, not only as a Frontend Developer but also as a Lead Frontend here. My responsibility is to ensure that the FE team can deliver quality results and produce maintainable and readable code. Additionally, I provide training and guidance to help my team grow. My task also involves ensuring that what is provided by stakeholders can be implemented according to the team's abilities and capabilities. Here, I also assist the UI/UX team and the QA team in providing input to their teams on how to contribute between teams. Being a Lead is not easy in my opinion because it requires precision, patience, and good abilities to balance everything. Since joining this company, I have successfully guided all IT teams (Engineers, PMs, QAs, Designers, etc.) to implement Agile Methodology and use JIRA as a tool for team management effectively and correctly. Previously, they were using Agile Methodology but the implementation was far from the Agile concept itself.

### Project Details
Portal Sekolah has been available since 2019 and has been used by dozens of schools across Indonesia. Initially, this project was handled by a team from India, and after I joined the team, I successfully improved several code flows, refactored code in dozens of features and components, where the flow was very messy and bugs often occurred, even in production. This required high precision because the refactoring had to ensure that the issues encountered were fixed without causing other issues. With my experience in education and finance, I also provided some inputs to stakeholders and project managers regarding changes in the flow, which ultimately improved the user experience.

### Key Achievements
- Successfully refactored and improved code flows in dozens of features and components
- Fixed production bugs and improved overall system stability
- Implemented Agile Methodology across all IT teams
- Introduced JIRA as an effective team management tool
- Provided guidance and training to frontend team members
- Collaborated with UI/UX and QA teams for better cross-team coordination
- Improved user experience through stakeholder and project manager consultation

## Scrum Master Volunteer (Freelance)

**Company:** VPN  
**Role:** Scrum Master Volunteer (Freelance)  
**Duration:** 2023 - 2024  

### Stack
- Trello (Legacy System)
- JIRA (Migration Target)
- Scrum Methodology
- Agile Project Management
- Team Training & Development

### Description
The company initially used Trello for task tracking, but it became overwhelming, lacked structure, and tasks had unclear statuses. There was a limitation of only 10 free Trello accounts. I suggested updating statuses in Trello and JIRA, and subsequently decided to migrate all tasks from Trello to JIRA, exploring ways to share the limited 10 free JIRA accounts across various roles. Through strategic efforts and support from the Engineering Manager, access to JIRA's standard premium features was obtained, allowing all engineers to be invited using their individual accounts. Many engineers were unfamiliar with Scrum methodology or JIRA, so I undertook efforts to train and familiarize the team with Scrum principles (e.g., self-organization, empiricism) and effective JIRA usage.
